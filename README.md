# IMDb-Retrieval-Project
This project explores Information Retrieval techniques using the IMDB reviews dataset. It involves indexing reviews, applying retrieval models (BM25, TF-IDF), and preprocessing text with Porter and Snowball stemming. Queries are run across combinations to analyze how retrieval models and preprocessing affect document rankings.
